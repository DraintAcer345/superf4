*0.9* - 2008-10-12:
  * You can now kill a process by pressing [[lolwiki the windows key]]+F4 and then clicking the window with your mouse. Note that the mouse cursor does not change to reflect that SuperF4 is in this mode. You can press escape or the right mouse button to exit this mode without killing a program.
  * Renamed keyhook.dll to hooks.dll.
  * Renamed log file to superf4-log.txt. 

*0.8b* - 2008-09-16: (Not mentioned in info.txt)
  * Fixed a minor typo.

*0.8* - 2008-09-16:
  * Made the detection of Ctrl+Alt+F4 more secure, preventing faulty kills which could happen when SuperF4 didn't receive the keyup of the F4 key.
  * Only one instance of SuperF4 can now be run. Starting SuperF4 again will make the first instance add its tray icon if hidden.

*0.7* - 2008-05-11:
  * keyhook now tries to get the SeDebugPrivilege privilege if OpenProcess fails, should be able to kill more programs.

  * Small fix to prevent the key pressed from being propagated to another window after terminating the process.

*0.5* - 2008-03-05:
  * Fixed a rare case where SuperF4 would kill a program when the user pressed Alt+F4.

*0.4* - 2008-02-24:
  * Option to autostart SuperF4. Can hide tray icon in current session.

*0.3* - 2008-02-14:
