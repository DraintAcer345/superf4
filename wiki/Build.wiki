#summary How to build SuperF4
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

You need [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW] to build SuperF4.
You can optionally use [http://upx.sourceforge.net/ upx] to compress the executable afterwards.

When you've installed MinGW you need to add it to PATH.
If you want to use upx, add it to PATH as well.

Now it should hopefully work if you run _build.bat_ in the trunk.

Add a comment if you have any issues.
