#summary How to build SuperF4
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

First you need to download the SuperF4 source code, {{{ svn co http://superf4.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ superf4 }}}.

Then to build SuperF4, you need [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW]. You only need to install _MinGW base tools_ (aka _Minimal_).

You then need to add MinGW to the PATH variable, so the build script can use the tools. Do this by _Right clicking_ on the _Computer_ desktop icon, go to the _Advanced_ tab, press the _Environment variables_ button, locate the _PATH_ system-wide variable, add _<MinGW path>\bin_ to the list, and press ok on all the dialogs.

If you want to build the installer you need [http://www.scratchpaper.com/ NSIS Unicode], put it in PATH as well.

Now it should hopefully work if you run _build.bat_.
