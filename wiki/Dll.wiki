#summary Why hooks.dll is necessary

[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644959(VS.85).aspx Microsoft's documentation] specifies that global hooks can only be made with the help of a dll file.

When dynamically linking to a dll file you must know the address to the function you want to call. You look up the address with the function name. This name might not be what you put in your source file, since the compiler mangles the name. I use a freeware utility called [http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dll_export_viewer.html DLL Export Viewer] to look up the correct name. In the mangled function name, the number after the @ sign indicates how many bytes are passed in parameters.

The next version will not contain a dll file since I found a way to make `SuperF4.exe` double as a dll file.
